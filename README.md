# Redux-logger
Redux-Logger is a middleware library for Redux, which is a popular state management library for JavaScript applications. Redux-Logger provides logging functionality to track and log the actions and state changes in a Redux application. It helps developers understand and debug how the state evolves over time.

When integrated into a Redux application, Redux-Logger logs information about the dispatched actions and the resulting state changes. It provides a detailed log of each action, including its type and payload, as well as the previous and next state. This can be incredibly useful during development and debugging, as it allows developers to inspect and track the flow of actions and how they impact the application state.

The log output from Redux-Logger is typically displayed in the browser console, providing a clear visualization of the action dispatches and state updates. The log entries often include timestamps, making it easier to understand the chronological order of actions and state changes.

Redux-Logger is a non-intrusive middleware, meaning it does not modify the behavior of the application itself but rather provides additional logging functionality. This makes it easy to integrate into existing Redux applications without affecting the core functionality.

Overall, Redux-Logger is a valuable tool for Redux developers, particularly during development and debugging phases. It helps in understanding how actions flow through the application and how the state is affected, providing insights into the application's behavior and aiding in identifying potential issues or bugs.
